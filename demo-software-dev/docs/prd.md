## 1. Executive Summary

The system enables employees to submit leave requests digitally and managers to approve/reject them efficiently through a simple, intuitive interface.

**Key Features:**
- Employee self-service leave requests
- Manager approval workflow
- Leave balance tracking
- Basic reporting dashboard
- Email/password authentication

**Timeline:** 4 weeks to production launch  
**Target Users:** Small companies currently using paper-based leave management

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current State
- Employees fill out paper forms for leave requests
- Forms are physically routed to managers for approval
- HR manually tracks leave balances in spreadsheets
- Process is slow, error-prone, and lacks transparency
- No real-time visibility into leave balances or team availability

### Pain Points
- **Employees:** Cannot check leave balances instantly, unsure of request status
- **Managers:** Delayed approvals, no visibility into team scheduling conflicts
- **HR:** Manual data entry, difficult to maintain accurate records
- **Company:** Compliance risks, lost paperwork, inefficient use of time

### Why Now
- Remote/hybrid work makes paper processes impractical
- Employee expectations for digital self-service have increased
- Need for accurate leave tracking for compliance and planning
- Opportunity to improve employee experience with minimal investment
