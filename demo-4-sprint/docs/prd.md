# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Leave Management System MVP

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Final  
**Timeline:** 2-week MVP Development  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Leave Management System MVP is a streamlined web-based solution designed to replace manual leave tracking processes for our 20-person startup. This system will provide employees with self-service capabilities to request leave and check balances, while enabling managers to efficiently approve requests and manage team leave. The MVP focuses on delivering core functionality within a 2-week timeline, emphasizing simplicity, usability, and rapid deployment.

**Key Value Propositions:**
- Eliminate manual tracking errors and confusion about leave balances
- Reduce administrative overhead by 80% through self-service
- Provide real-time visibility into leave balances and request status
- Enable mobile access for remote request submission and approval

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
Our organization currently tracks employee leave through manual processes (spreadsheets, emails, paper forms), leading to:
- **Lack of transparency:** Employees don't have real-time visibility into their leave balances
- **Process inefficiency:** Managers spend excessive time tracking and approving leave requests
- **Error-prone tracking:** Manual calculations lead to disputes about remaining balances
- **No audit trail:** Difficult to track historical leave patterns and approvals
- **Mobile limitations:** Cannot submit or approve leave requests on-the-go

### Impact
- Employee frustration due to uncertainty about leave balances
- Manager time waste (estimated 3-4 hours/week on leave administration)
- HR disputes requiring manual reconciliation
- Delayed approval processes affecting employee planning

---

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Automation:** Replace 100% of manual leave tracking within 2 weeks
2. **Transparency:** Provide real-time leave balance visibility to all employees
3. **Efficiency:** Reduce leave administration time by 80%
4. **Accessibility:** Enable mobile access for 100% of leave operations

### Success Criteria
- MVP deployed and operational within 14 days
- All 20 employees successfully onboarded and using the system
- Zero manual tracking required post-implementation
- < 2 minute average time for leave request submission
- < 1 minute average time for manager approval/rejection
