## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **Database Performance**
   - Pre-sprint: Add indexes during schema creation
   - Mitigation: Monitor query performance, add indexes as needed
   - Contingency: Implement caching layer if required

2. **Authentication Security**
   - Pre-sprint: Use established libraries (bcrypt, jsonwebtoken)
   - Mitigation: Follow OWASP guidelines
   - Contingency: Security audit in Sprint 5

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Pre-sprint: Use widely supported features
   - Mitigation: Test on multiple browsers early
   - Contingency: Polyfills for unsupported features

### Process Risks
1. **Scope Creep**
   - Pre-sprint: Clearly defined MVP scope in PRD
   - Mitigation: Defer new features to post-MVP
   - Contingency: Use 1.5-day buffer for critical additions

2. **Integration Issues**
   - Pre-sprint: Define API contracts early
   - Mitigation: Parallel development with mock data
   - Contingency: Dev pair programming for complex integrations

3. **Timeline Delays**
   - Pre-sprint: Conservative estimates with buffer
   - Mitigation: Daily standups, impediment removal
   - Contingency: Reduce nice-to-have features if needed
