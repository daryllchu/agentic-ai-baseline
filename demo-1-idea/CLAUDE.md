# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a demonstration project for agentic AI in software development, created for the NUS-ISS Learning Fest 2025 talk "Practical Agentic AI in Software Development". The project showcases the entire software development lifecycle using agentic AI across planning, design, and implementation phases.

## Development Workflow Commands

The repository uses slash commands to demonstrate different phases of the software development lifecycle:

- `/plan-and-analyze` - Define goals, requirements, scope, research and generate Product Requirement Document (PRD) at `docs/prd.md`
- `/design` - Define project architecture, software stack, database design, UI and generate Software Design Document (SDD) at `docs/sdd.md`
- `/sprint-plan` - Break down PRD and SDD into sprints with clear goals, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and progress tracking at `docs/sprint.md`

## Architecture and Structure

This is primarily a documentation-driven demonstration project that follows IBM's Software Development Life Cycle methodology:

1. **Planning Phase** - Requirements gathering and PRD creation
2. **Design Phase** - Architecture definition and SDD creation
3. **Sprint Planning Phase** - Work breakdown into 2.5-day sprints

All outputs are stored in the `docs/` directory as Markdown files for easy review and tracking of the agentic development process.

## File Organization

- `README.md` - Project overview and talk details
- `docs/` - Contains all generated documentation from the agentic workflow
  - `prd.md` - Product Requirements Document (generated by `/plan-and-analyze`)
  - `sdd.md` - Software Design Document (generated by `/design`)
  - `sprint.md` - Sprint planning breakdown (generated by `/sprint-plan`)
- `.claude/` - Claude Code configuration and permissions

## Development Notes

This project demonstrates agentic AI coordination across the full software development lifecycle, with emphasis on requirement analysis, product planning, implementation strategy, and project management through AI agents.

## A2A Communications

Valid agent roles:
- `engineer`
- `pm`

If are unsure of your role, ask for clarification before proceeding.

Check your inbox the first thing before carrying on with your task.

- Use `docs/inbox/` for communications between agents.
- `docs/inbox/engineers.md` are messages meant for engineer agents only, usually from Product Manager.
- `docs/inbox/pm.md` are messages meant for product manager agents only, usually from engineers.
- Once you have read an inbox message that is meant for you, only if you are sure of your role, mark the message as READ by adding a line `READ by {role}` at the top.
