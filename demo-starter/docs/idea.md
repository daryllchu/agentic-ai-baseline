# Idea

## Goals

We want to make a web-based leave management system for our small company.

## Requirements

1. The product must be web-based, accessible via modern web browsers and mobile browsers.
2. Simple user authentication (email/password).
3. Employees can apply for leave. Managers can approve or reject leave requests.
4. Employees can view their leave balance and leave history.

## Scope

### In scope

1. Web-based UI
2. Basic user authentication (email/password)
3. Leave application and approval workflow
4. Leave balance and history view
5. HR can create and manage employee accounts and leave policies unique to each employee.

### Out of scope

1. Any forms of notifications.
2. Admin panel.
3. Integration with third-party systems (e.g., payroll, calendar).
4. Mobile app.
5. Advanced reporting and analytics.

## Notes, considerations and constraints

We need it fast. Focus on MVP. We need to launch this in 4 weeks. Other features can be added later after MVP launch.

For this project now, do not include non-MVP specs.
