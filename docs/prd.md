## 1. Executive Summary

The HR Data Exchange Hub is a cloud-based ETL platform designed to integrate employee data from multiple HR systems (starting with Workday) and provide standardized API responses. The platform solves data format inconsistencies and communication barriers between HR systems through automated data transformation and mapping capabilities.

**Target Launch:** 4 weeks from project start
**Primary Audience:** Data consumers and IT integration teams
**Platform:** Web-based ETL platform with API services

## 2. Problem Statement

Organizations with multiple HR systems face significant data integration challenges that hinder operational efficiency and analytics capabilities. Current pain points include:

- **System Communication Barriers**: Multiple HR systems cannot communicate effectively, creating data silos
- **Manual Data Processes**: Time-consuming manual export/import processes via SFTP scheduled jobs
- **Data Format Inconsistencies**: Different HR systems use varying data formats and standards, making integration complex
- **Lack of Standardization**: No unified data model for employee information across systems
- **Integration Complexity**: IT teams struggle with custom point-to-point integrations

These challenges result in delayed reporting, inconsistent data quality, and increased operational overhead for HR and IT teams.
