## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High Priority Risks
1. **XML Parsing Complexity**
   - *Risk:* Workday XML structure variations
   - *Mitigation:* Start with sample XML files, build flexible parser
   - *Contingency:* Focus on core fields first, add complex fields post-MVP

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - *Risk:* ETL processing may be slower than expected
   - *Mitigation:* Implement parallel processing early, optimize database queries
   - *Contingency:* Reduce batch size, implement progressive processing

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - *Risk:* Frontend-backend integration issues
   - *Mitigation:* Define API contracts early, use mock data for parallel development
   - *Contingency:* Simplify UI interactions, focus on core functionality

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **AWS Infrastructure Costs**
   - *Risk:* Higher than expected infrastructure costs
   - *Mitigation:* Use smallest viable instance sizes, implement auto-scaling
   - *Contingency:* Optimize resource usage, consider cost-effective alternatives

2. **Data Quality Issues**
   - *Risk:* Poor data quality in source XML files
   - *Mitigation:* Implement comprehensive validation, provide clear error messages
   - *Contingency:* Add data cleansing capabilities, manual data correction interface
