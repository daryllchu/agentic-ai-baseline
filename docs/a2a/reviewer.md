## Recommendations for Sprint 2

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **ETL Framework Setup**: Begin Celery and Redis integration
2. **File Upload System**: Implement S3 integration for XML files
3. **XML Processing**: Start basic XML parsing with lxml
4. **Job Monitoring**: Create job status tracking system

### Technical Considerations
1. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for ETL processes
2. **Logging**: Implement structured logging for job tracking
3. **Validation**: Add comprehensive XML validation
4. **Performance**: Consider async processing for large files

### Risk Mitigation
1. **XML Complexity**: Start with simple Workday XML samples
2. **Performance**: Implement batch processing early
3. **Error Recovery**: Design robust error handling from start
